# Skewness
# Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the symmetry or asymmetry in the distribution of data.
# If a dataset follows a Normal Distribution (bell-shaped curve), it is perfectly symmetrical, and skewness is 0.
# When the data deviates from normality, skewness measures the degree and direction of asymmetry.
