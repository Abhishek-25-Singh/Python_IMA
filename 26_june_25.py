# Python dose The inferencing Automatically.
a = 10.226  # float
b = 5.229  # Float
c = a + b  # result(c) also be float because both operands (a,b) are float
print("a + b = ",c)
print("Type of c :",type(c))
print("Round od The Value upto 2 Decimal :",round(c,2))


x = 10  # x infers This as Integer
y = 10.5 # y infers This as Float
z = "hello" # z infers This as String
# Here You Never Told Python That "x is Integer","y is Float" and "z is String" Python infers it From The Value.
